Programming assignments are likely to contain logical errors
The conventional way of detecting a logical error is an instructor assisting those errors to a large number of students which is extremely challenging.It is often easier to provide a correct implementation rather than search for logical errors in an error-ridden program.
Instructors providing feedback on  logical errors are more complex than syntax or type errors.
\par  Generic feedback on logical errors when given to students is mostly ineffective.The standard way of giving feedback on logical errors is failed test cases.Providing the answer code is also troublesome as there are many ways to implement the program.The aim of this project focuses on developing a system that identifies the source of logical errors in an error-ridden program.The system then compares the error-ridden code to a error free reference implementation of the same algorithm and also identifies the failed testcase.
