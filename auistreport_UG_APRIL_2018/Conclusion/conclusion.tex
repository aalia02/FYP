\section{\uppercase{CONCLUSION}}
This documentation explains the working of automatic diagnosis of logical errors based on a reference implementation and testcases generated for a particular source code.The KLEE tool was implemented for testcase generation and using clang libraries the control flow graph is generated and error localization is performed to mark the lines that have an error.
\section{\uppercase{FUTURE WORK}}
Future works will aim to find a way to enhance the localisation of logical errors and suggest solutions to those errors that were localised in a particular source code.This will help programmers to code easily and save time in fixing these logical errors
